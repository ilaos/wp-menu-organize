- **Plain language** - Avoid jargon like "autosave," "server storage," "diagnostics"
- **Actionable** - Use verbs (manage, track, customize, configure)
- **Concise** - 1-2 sentences maximum

### Examples of Good vs Bad:

**BAD:** "Configure draft autosave, server storage, and privacy settings."
- Technical terms, implementation-focused

**GOOD:** "Control how draft selections are saved and configure lead capture settings."
- User benefit-focused, plain language

**BAD:** "Diagnostic tools for administrators."
- Vague, technical

**GOOD:** "Test email delivery, clean up old data, and optimize database performance."
- Specific actions, clear benefits
