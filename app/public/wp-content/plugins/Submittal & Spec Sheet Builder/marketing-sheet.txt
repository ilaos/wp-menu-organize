From: Submittal form builder (chatgpt)

who or what type of industry(s) is this form typically used for? Is the submittal form a real thing? Do some industries use them more than others? Is our form so far flexible for any of these industries? I'm just trying to understand who this is useful for
ChatGPT said:

Excellent question — yes, submittal forms are very real and quite standardized in several industries, though your plugin version is more flexible and could evolve into a broader “document packet builder” tool.

Here’s a breakdown:

🏗️ 1. Industries That Commonly Use Submittal Forms

Submittals are mostly used in construction and manufacturing contexts — any field where one party must submit technical documentation for approval before fabrication, installation, or delivery.

Top industries:

Architectural / Construction / Engineering (AEC)

Most common use.

Contractors submit product data, shop drawings, and compliance sheets to architects or engineers.

Example: “Framing Submittal” showing all the metal studs, track, and fasteners being used — exactly like what your demo resembles.

HVAC, Electrical, Plumbing

Submittals confirm that installed systems (e.g., ducting, chillers, lighting) meet specifications.

Industrial Manufacturing & Fabrication

Used to submit component specs (steel, bolts, coatings, etc.) for supplier approval.

Civil Infrastructure / Government Contracts

Required for compliance with federal/state specs (DOT, FAA, etc.).

📋 2. What a Submittal Form Typically Contains

Most submittal packets include:

Product data sheets (e.g., PDF from manufacturer)

Model numbers

Material specs (thickness, finish, size)

Compliance certifications (ASTM, UL, etc.)

Revision history

Approver signature line (optional)

Your plugin currently mimics the “Product Data Submittal” portion of that process — a configurable hierarchy of Categories → Products → Types → Models with metadata (size, flange, KSI, etc.), all exportable as a branded PDF.
That’s exactly what framing or structural trades would expect.

🌍 3. How Flexible It Is Beyond Construction

Your current architecture is already flexible enough for other industries that involve hierarchical selections + PDF output, for example:

Manufacturing catalogs – Building product sheets per client.

Architecture design firms – Generating fixture/equipment submittals.

IT procurement – Submitting grouped hardware/software specs.

Interior design / furniture – Submittals for finishes, fabrics, and furniture.

Environmental compliance – Submitting grouped certification data.

Because the backend lets users define their own categories, products, and models, it could easily adapt to:

“Any industry where a collection of standardized documents needs to be grouped, previewed, and exported for approval.”

💡 4. Strategic Note

If you frame your plugin generically (e.g. “Spec Packet Builder” or “Document Submittal Builder”), you can target:

Construction companies first (core audience, clear use case)

Then expand to engineering, procurement, or manufacturing

Your “Seed Catalog” could even be named “Construction Framing Example” to make the first audience clear but still show that others could reconfigure it.

Would you like me to outline how we could make the plugin’s description and onboarding wording more universal — so it attracts both construction professionals and other spec-based industries without confusing either?

You said:
Yes
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — here’s a concise plan to rebrand and reposition your plugin so it appeals to both construction pros and other spec-driven industries, without losing authenticity or confusing either audience.

🧩 1. Core Positioning Statement

“A smart, visual way to organize, approve, and export technical data sheets, product specs, and submittal packets — for construction, engineering, and manufacturing teams.”

This keeps it grounded in real-world usage (submittals) while opening the door for broader applications (product catalogs, engineering packets, procurement bundles).

🏗️ 2. Target Industries (Tiered Wording)

Primary Audience (speak directly):

Construction contractors

Engineers

Architects

Fabricators

HVAC / Electrical / Plumbing trades

Secondary Audience (include lightly):

Manufacturing / Industrial

Product distributors

Equipment suppliers

Procurement / compliance managers

Marketing line example:

“Built for construction — flexible enough for any industry that manages specs, drawings, and approvals.”

🧭 3. Rename or Subtitle Options for Plugin

Your current working title (“Submittal Form Builder”) is perfect for construction audiences, but we can future-proof it with one of these variants:

Option	Title	Subtitle / Tagline
✅ Submittal Builder Pro	“Create, manage, and export technical submittals with ease.”	
Spec Packet Builder	“Organize specs, products, and approvals — your way.”	
SpecForm WP	“The easiest way to build, export, and share product submittals.”	
Blueprint Docs	“Smart document builder for construction and engineering projects.”	

If you plan to stay within construction and adjacent trades, stick with Submittal Builder Pro — it has industry credibility.

If you want broader flexibility, Spec Packet Builder sounds more universal while keeping the technical tone.

🖥️ 4. Onboarding & UI Copy Revisions

We can make subtle changes to make the interface feel natural for all users:

Current Term	Broader / Clearer Alternative
“Seed Demo”	“Load Sample Catalog”
“Generate Packet”	“Export Submittal” or “Export Packet”
“Categories / Products / Types / Models”	Keep as-is (these are universally understood)
“Branding”	“Brand & Header Settings”
“Submittal Builder” (sidebar tab)	“Builder” or “Spec Builder”

These changes ensure that a structural engineer and a product manager both feel like it’s “for them.”

📦 5. Suggested Future Options (Lightweight Add-ons)

Once your MVP is solid, here are easy ways to make it even more industry-flexible:

Schema Templates: Let users choose from a few default tree setups:

Construction (Framing / HVAC)

Manufacturing (Components / Materials)

Engineering (Systems / Models)

Export Types: Add “Excel” and “HTML Preview” exports alongside PDF.

Approval Signature Section: Optional footer on PDF (for formal submittals).

Custom Fields Manager: To let users rename or add new spec fields (beyond Size, Flange, etc.).

Would you like me to create a version of your plugin description + onboarding welcome message that reflects this new universal positioning (so it could be used in your WordPress plugin listing and in the dashboard)?

Not yet. As for a name, I need it to be something keyword friendly that people search for.  But do different industries were targeting have different names for these? Or do they all generally call it one main term?
ChatGPT said:

Excellent question — and you’re asking the right one from an SEO and product-market-fit perspective.
Here’s what the keyword and terminology landscape looks like across industries:

🔍 1. Keyword Reality Check by Industry
Industry	What They Actually Call It	Common Keywords Used in Searches	Example Search Queries
Construction / Architecture / Engineering (AEC)	Submittal, Construction Submittal, Submittal Package, Submittal Log, Spec Sheet	construction submittal, project submittal form, submittal package template, submittal builder, construction spec sheets	“create construction submittal,” “how to organize submittals,” “construction spec sheet generator”
Manufacturing / Industrial	Product Data Sheet, Specification Sheet, Technical Data Packet	product data sheet builder, spec sheet template, technical data sheet PDF generator	“generate product spec sheet PDF,” “spec sheet WordPress plugin”
HVAC / Plumbing / Electrical / Mechanical Trades	Submittal, Cut Sheet, Equipment Schedule	HVAC submittal, plumbing submittal, electrical submittal software	“HVAC submittal builder,” “electrical submittal PDF generator”
Procurement / Compliance / OEM	Product Specification, Technical Packet, Supplier Docs	product specification form, technical document builder	“generate supplier spec documents,” “product technical packet tool”
🧭 2. The Unifying Insight

“Submittal” is king in the construction ecosystem (architects, engineers, contractors).

“Spec Sheet” / “Data Sheet” / “Technical Packet” are more common in manufacturing and industrial contexts.

However, most industries understand the term “submittal” once they see it—it has credibility and professionalism baked in.
→ e.g., “Spec Sheet” sounds basic, while “Submittal” sounds formal and project-grade.

🧩 3. SEO Takeaway

If you want maximum discoverability, the smart move is hybrid naming — one that captures both keyword clusters.

Best SEO-friendly options:
Option	Keyword Reach	Notes
Submittal Builder Pro	✅ “Submittal” + “Builder” — dominant AEC keywords	High authority with construction audience
Spec Sheet Builder	✅ “Spec Sheet,” “Specification Sheet,” “Data Sheet”	High relevance in manufacturing
Submittal & Spec Sheet Builder	✅✅ Covers both clusters; hybrid keyword powerhouse	Excellent SEO balance; slightly long
SpecPacket Builder	⚙️ “Spec Packet” + “Builder” — brandable but less searched	Better for branding than pure SEO
Smart Submittal Builder	✅ Adds “Smart” (AI/automation modifier)	Good brand longevity and keyword friendliness
💡 Recommendation (SEO-Driven)

If your goal is WordPress plugin marketplace visibility + broad professional appeal, go with:

Submittal & Spec Sheet Builder

It’s keyword-dense, covers both industries’ terminology, and sounds professional rather than gimmicky.
Then use a subtitle like:

“Generate professional submittals, spec sheets, and data packets — right inside WordPress.”

Would you like me to check live search data (Google + WP plugin repo keywords) to confirm which version of the name has the strongest ranking potential right now?

ChatGPT said:

I did some digging — there isn’t a perfect source that gives solid, direct volume numbers for “submittal builder plugin” vs “spec sheet builder plugin” in WordPress, but here’s what I found + what I infer. This should help you pick a name with confidence.

🔍 What I found

There’s no major WordPress plugin already named Submittal Builder (at least none dominant).

The term “submittal” is heavily used in AEC (architecture, engineering, construction) communities for the process of submitting shop drawings, specs, compliance docs, etc.

Spec sheet / specification sheet is a well known term in manufacturing, product development, and hardware documentation, though I didn’t find major WP plugins using “spec sheet builder” as their name.

WordPress plugin repositories tend to have many “form builder,” “PDF generator,” “document generator” tools, but niche ones like yours (structured hierarchical spec/submittal) are rare, which gives you an SEO opportunity.

Because of this, the terms “submittal” and “spec sheet / specification” both carry domain credibility in different verticals. You don’t want to pick a term that’s unknown in your target industry.

🧠 What the signals suggest

For the construction / AEC vertical, using “Submittal” is safer and more quickly understood.

For manufacturing / product / hardware verticals, “Spec Sheet / Spec Packet / Specification” will resonate more.

Because your product crosses verticals, the hybrid naming or compound name (e.g. “Submittal & Spec Sheet Builder”) makes sense — you capture both sides.

Also, avoid names so generic that you compete with big “form builder” or “PDF generator” plugins. The more you lean into your niche (submittals, hierarchical specs), the more keyword traction you can own.

✅ My recommendation (based on evidence + niche clarity)

Go with:

“Submittal & Spec Sheet Builder”

Reasoning:

Captures the most searched “submittal” term for your core AEC audience.

Adds “Spec Sheet” to also attract manufacturing and engineering audiences.

Signals a builder / generator — not just a passive viewer tool.

Still unique enough that you’re unlikely to face direct competition for the exact phrase in WP plugin directories.

You can also use taglines and SEO meta text to include other related terms like “spec packet,” “product data sheet,” “technical packet generator,” etc.

If you want, I can run a deeper keyword volume check using Ahrefs / SEMrush / Google Ads for your top name options and send you a comparison (with projected traffic). Do you want me to do that next?
