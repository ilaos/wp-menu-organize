# CHANGELOG: Agency Library - Save as Pack

## Phase A: Initial Implementation (2025-10-11)

### Overview
Implemented complete Agency Library system for saving, managing, and deploying reusable catalog Packs across multiple sites. This feature enables fast onboarding for multi-site deployments and white-label solutions.

### New Features

#### Agency Library Admin Page
- **New submenu:** "ðŸ“¦ Agency Library" (only visible to Agency license holders)
- **Pack management table:**
  - Pack name with creation date
  - Product count
  - Branding indicator (âœ“ if included)
  - Last updated timestamp
  - Export JSON button (nonce-secured download)
  - Delete button with confirmation
- **Empty state UI:**
  - Helpful instructions for first-time users
  - "Go to Builder" call-to-action button
  - How-to guide for creating and using Packs

#### Save as Pack (Builder)
- **New toolbar button:** "ðŸ’¼ Save as Pack" (Agency-gated)
  - Located in Builder admin page toolbar
  - Only visible to Agency license holders
  - Positioned after Import JSON button
- **Save Pack modal:**
  - Pack name input (required)
  - "Include branding settings" checkbox (default: checked)
  - "Include product notes" checkbox (default: unchecked)
  - Real-time validation (name required)
  - Loading state during save
  - Success toast with product count

#### Pack Data Model
- **Storage:** WordPress options API (`sfb_agency_packs`)
- **Pack structure:**
  - `id` - UUID (wp_generate_uuid4)
  - `name` - User-provided Pack name
  - `counts` - Product/node counts
  - `has_branding` - Boolean flag
  - `updated_at` - MySQL datetime
  - `data` - Complete Pack payload:
    - `form` - Form metadata
    - `nodes` - All nodes with full settings
    - `branding` - Optional branding settings object
- **Node format:** Raw nodes (different from industry pack categories structure)

#### Pack Export
- **AJAX endpoint:** `sfb_pack_export`
- **Security:**
  - Nonce verification (one-time per Pack)
  - Admin capability check
  - Agency license validation
  - Pack ID sanitization
- **Download:**
  - Content-Type: application/json
  - Filename: `{pack-name}.json`
  - Complete Pack data structure

#### Seeder Integration
- **New parameter:** `agency_pack_id` for `/sfb/v1/form/seed` endpoint
- **Functionality:**
  - Load Pack from database by UUID
  - Remap node IDs to avoid conflicts
  - Apply branding if Pack includes it and `with_branding=true`
  - Support both `replace` and `merge` modes
  - Returns `pack_type: "agency"` in response
- **Backwards compatible:** Existing `industry_pack` parameter still works

### Documentation Updates

  - Complete feature description
  - Save as Pack workflow
  - Agency Library page details
  - Seeder integration notes
- Updated Admin Pages section (lines 592-598)
  - Added Agency Library page entry

#### API-REFERENCE.md

  - Exporting Packs
  - Deploying to client sites
  - Managing Packs
  - Best practices
  - Real-world workflow example
  - Agency license requirements

### Technical Details

#### License Gating
- **Function:** `sfb_is_agency_license()`
- **Dev override:** `SFB_AGENCY_DEV` constant
- **Checks performed:**
  - Admin menu registration
  - REST endpoint permission callbacks
  - AJAX handler security checks
  - UI button visibility (JavaScript)

#### ID Remapping Strategy
When importing Agency Packs, node IDs must be remapped to avoid conflicts:
```php
$id_map = []; // old_id => new_id
foreach ($nodes as $node) {
  $old_id = $node['id'];
  $new_parent = isset($id_map[$node['parent_id']])
    ? $id_map[$node['parent_id']]
    : null;

  $wpdb->insert($nodes_table, [/* ... */]);
  $new_id = $wpdb->insert_id;
  $id_map[$old_id] = $new_id;
}
```

#### Data Format Differences
- **Industry Packs:** Use `categories[]` structure with nested hierarchy
- **Agency Packs:** Use flat `nodes[]` array with `parent_id` references
- **Seeder:** Detects format and uses appropriate import logic

#### Performance Considerations
- Pack save response excludes full data (only metadata returned)
- Export streams JSON directly to download (no intermediate storage)
- Node counts tracked during import (no separate query needed)
- Branding settings stored as separate key in Pack data

### Security Considerations

1. **REST Endpoint:**
   - Requires `manage_options` capability
   - Agency license validation
   - Input sanitization (Pack name)

2. **AJAX Export:**
   - Nonce verification per Pack ID
   - Admin capability check
   - Agency license validation
   - Pack ID sanitization

3. **Pack Data:**
   - No user credentials stored
   - No license keys included
   - Branding settings sanitized on save
   - Node data validated on import

### Testing Performed

âœ… Save Pack with branding and notes
âœ… Save Pack without branding
âœ… Save Pack without notes
âœ… Export Pack as JSON download
âœ… Delete Pack from Library
âœ… Import Pack on another site (seeder integration)
âœ… ID remapping on import (no conflicts)
âœ… Branding application on import
âœ… Agency license gating (UI hidden when not Agency)
âœ… REST endpoint permissions
âœ… AJAX nonce verification
âœ… Empty state UI display

### Known Limitations

1. **No Pack Renaming:** Must delete and recreate with new name
2. **No Pack Import UI:** Must manually upload JSON and use seeder
3. **No Pack Versioning:** Manual version tracking in Pack names recommended
4. **No Pack Preview:** Can't preview contents before importing
5. **No Partial Import:** All-or-nothing import (can't select specific products)

### Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- Pack import UI (drag & drop JSON upload)
- Pack rename functionality
- Pack version history
- Pack preview/diff tool
- Selective product import from Packs
- Pack templates/categories
- Pack sharing between Agency accounts
- Pack marketplace/directory

### Acceptance Criteria Status

âœ… **Save current catalog as Pack**
- Button in Builder toolbar
- Modal with name and options
- Stores in `sfb_agency_packs`

âœ… **View Packs in Agency Library**
- Dedicated admin page
- Table with Pack details
- Empty state for new users

âœ… **Export Pack as JSON**
- Export button in Library
- Downloads as JSON file
- Includes all Pack data

âœ… **Seed Pack on another site**
- Seeder accepts `agency_pack_id`
- Remaps IDs on import
- Applies branding if requested
- Works with replace/merge modes

### Deployment Notes

**No database migrations required** - Uses WordPress options API

**No new tables** - All data stored in `sfb_agency_packs` option

**Backwards compatible** - Existing seeder calls continue to work

**Agency license required** - Features completely hidden without Agency license
