# Implementation Summary: Demo Tools & Upgrade Menu Visibility

## Overview
This implementation adds proper license state-based menu visibility controls for the "Demo Tools" and "‚≠ê Upgrade" menu items in the Submittal & Spec Sheet Builder plugin.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added SFB_SHOW_DEMO_TOOLS Constant
**File:** `submittal-form-builder.php` (lines 19-22)

```php
// Global toggle for Demo Tools (production: false, development: true)
if (!defined('SFB_SHOW_DEMO_TOOLS')) {
  define('SFB_SHOW_DEMO_TOOLS', false);
}
```

- Default value: `false` (production mode)
- Can be overridden in `wp-config.php` by adding: `define('SFB_SHOW_DEMO_TOOLS', true);`
- Controls whether Demo Tools menu appears for admin users

### 2. Added License State Mapping
**File:** `Includes/class-sfb-admin.php` (lines 23-46)

Added `get_license_state()` method that maps license status to one of four states:
- `free` - No active license
- `expired` - License expired or invalid
- `pro` - Active Pro license
- `agency` - Active Agency license

### 3. Updated Admin Menu Registration
**File:** `Includes/class-sfb-admin.php` (lines 48-233)

#### Demo Tools (lines 171-183)
- Only shows when `SFB_SHOW_DEMO_TOOLS === true` AND user has `manage_options` capability
- Replaced old `SFB_DEV_MODE` check

#### Upgrade Menu (lines 185-224)
- Shows only for `free` and `expired` license states
- Hidden for `pro` and `agency` license states
- Labeled as "‚≠ê Upgrade"

#### License & Support Menu
- Shows for `pro` and `agency` license states
- Hidden for `free` and `expired` states

#### Belt-and-Suspenders Safeguard (lines 226-232)
- Automatically removes Demo Tools menu for Free/Expired states
- Ensures production safety even if constant is accidentally enabled
- Runs on `admin_head` action
