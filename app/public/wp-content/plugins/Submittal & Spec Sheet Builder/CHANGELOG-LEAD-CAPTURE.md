## Recent Updates (2025-10-11)

### UX Enhancements
Added three key UX improvements to the lead capture modal:

1. **Real-time Form Validation**
   - Submit button now disabled until email is valid AND consent is checked
   - Live validation on input, blur, and change events
   - Accessible with `aria-disabled` attributes
   - **File:** `assets/js/lead-capture.js` (lines 59-91)

2. **Auto-populate Project Name**
   - Modal displays project name when provided from Review page
   - HTML element added to modal template
   - **Files:**
     - `assets/js/lead-capture.js` (lines 104-109)
     - `templates/frontend/partials/modal-lead-capture.php` (line 38)

3. **Success Message**
   - Shows "Thank you! Generating your submittal packet..." after submission
   - 1.5 second delay before closing modal and continuing to PDF
   - **File:** `assets/js/lead-capture.js` (lines 275-296)

### Admin Interface - NEW!
Added comprehensive admin page to view and manage captured leads:

**Location:** Admin > Submittal Builder > Leads

**Features:**
- **Lead Table** with columns: Date, Email, Phone, Project, Items, Top Category, Consent, UTM, Actions
- **Search Filter**: Search by email, project name, or UTM data
- **Date Range Filters**: Filter leads by "From Date" and "To Date"
- **Pagination**: 25 leads per page with WordPress-style navigation
- **CSV Export**: Export filtered leads to CSV with all data fields
- **View Details Modal**: Click "Details" on any lead to see:
  - Full UTM breakdown (all 5 parameters)
  - IP Hash (first 8 characters only for privacy)
  - All lead information in formatted table
- **Stats Summary**: Total leads count displayed prominently

**Implementation:**
- Menu item only shows when Pro is active AND `sfb_lead_capture_enabled` is true
- CSV export runs in `admin_init` hook to prevent "headers already sent" errors
- Nonce protection on all export actions
- SQL prepared statements for security
- **File:** `submittal-form-builder.php` (lines 495-508, 3143-3426, 4072-4147)

**Commits:**
- `0af2d3e` - UX enhancements to lead capture modal
- `7c2b44f` - Leads admin page with view and CSV export
- `d9a0bbb` - Fix CSV export headers already sent error
