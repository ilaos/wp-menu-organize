## Screenshot Best Practices

### Before Capturing
- [ ] Use realistic sample data (not "test" or "asdf")
- [ ] Fill in all visible form fields
- [ ] Use consistent branding (same colors/logo across screenshots)
- [ ] Clear browser cache/disable extensions that add UI clutter
- [ ] Maximize browser window (1400px+ width recommended)

### During Capture
- [ ] Use **Snagit**, **ShareX**, **Greenshot**, or macOS Screenshot (Cmd+Shift+4)
- [ ] Capture at 100% browser zoom for sharpness
- [ ] Include enough context (WP admin sidebar, page title visible)
- [ ] Avoid capturing personal data (use fake company names/addresses)

### After Capture
- [ ] Resize to **1200-1600px width** (keeps file size reasonable)
- [ ] Add **1px border** (#e5e7eb or #cccccc) for cleaner WP.org display
- [ ] Optimize with **TinyPNG** or **ImageOptim** (target <200KB per screenshot)
- [ ] Rename files: `screenshot-1.png`, `screenshot-2.png`, etc.
- [ ] Save to plugin's `assets/` directory (for SVN upload)

### Accessibility Notes
- Screenshots should have descriptive captions in readme.txt
- Avoid relying solely on color to convey meaning
- Use high contrast (dark text on light background)
