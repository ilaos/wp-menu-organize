### 2. POT File Generation ⚠️

**Status:** WP-CLI not installed

**Manual alternative options:**

#### Option A: Install WP-CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Download WP-CLI
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar

# Make executable
chmod +x wp-cli.phar
sudo mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp

# Generate POT
wp i18n make-pot . languages/submittal-builder.pot --exclude=.git,node_modules,vendor,lib,dompdf
```

#### Option B: Use Poedit (GUI tool)
1. Download Poedit: https://poedit.net/
2. Open Poedit
3. File → New from source code
4. Select plugin directory
5. Click "Extract strings"
6. Save as `languages/submittal-builder.pot`

#### Option C: Use Loco Translate Plugin
1. Install Loco Translate plugin in WordPress
2. Go to Loco Translate → Plugins → Submittal & Spec Sheet Builder
3. Click "New template"
4. It will generate the POT file automatically

#### Option D: WordPress.org Build System
- The wordpress.org build system will automatically generate a POT file from your code when you submit
- This is the easiest option if you don't need local translation testing

**Recommendation:** Use Option D (let wordpress.org handle it) unless you need local testing.
