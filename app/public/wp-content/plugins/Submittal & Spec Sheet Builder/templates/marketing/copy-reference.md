Submittal & Spec Sheet Builder helps you turn product selections into polished, branded PDF packets. It's not a store or checkout—it's a documentation tool for technical selections. Visitors (or your team) pick items from your catalog, and the plugin exports a packet with a cover page, summary, table of contents, and detailed spec sheets.

• Contractors/Subs — compile submittals for architects and owners
• Architects/Engineers — bundle selected materials/equipment into a transmittal/spec set

• Consistent, on-brand documentation
• Clear specs for procurement and field teams
