● Bootstrap file created successfully! The file has been overwritten with the exact code provided.

  Summary of changes:
  - Removed the init() method and its hook
  - Simplified enqueue_admin() to use ['jquery'] dependencies instead of WP-specific ones
  - Simplified enqueue_front() similarly
  - Updated shortcode to only accept id parameter (removed show_leed and cover_sheet)
  - Replaced full REST API routes with a simple /health endpoint stub
  - Removed API methods: api_get_form(), api_generate(), api_share()

  The file is ready for activation. You can now:
  1. Activate the plugin in WP Admin → Plugins
  2. Check the admin page at Submittal Builder in the sidebar
  3. Test the shortcode [submittal_builder id="1"] on a page
  4. Verify the REST endpoint at /wp-json/sfb/v1/health

Your last-mile checklist (plain English)

Put 2 images in your plugin folder

Place these files in /assets/:

banner-772x250.png

icon-256x256.png

(I made drafts already. Want them recolored to your brand? Just give me your hex color.)

Take 6 screenshots

Save in /assets/ as:

screenshot-1.png … screenshot-6.png

What to shoot: Builder, Sidebar item details, Branding page, Upgrade page, PDF cover+summary+TOC, Product sheet.

Quick self-test (QA)

Generate all 3 PDF layouts (technical, packet, branded).

Click TOC links → jump to pages.

Page numbers show “Page X of Y”.

Uninstall plugin → it cleans up options/uploads.

Try on PHP 7.4 and PHP 8.1+ if you can (Local makes this easy).

Validate your readme

Use the official “readme.txt validator” (search that exact phrase).

It should say PASS.

Submit to WordPress.org

Create the plugin on WordPress.org to get your SVN URL.

When approved:

Put your plugin code in trunk/

Put your images (banner, icon, screenshots) in assets/

Commit, then copy trunk to tags/1.0.0 (that’s your first release)

That’s it. If you want, give me your brand primary hex and I’ll regenerate the banner & icon on-brand so you can drop them straight in.


-----------------


Yep—use a dev override so everything behaves as Pro without a license.

Quickest switch (one line)

Add this to wp-config.php (anywhere above /* That's all, stop editing! */):

define('SFB_PRO_DEV', true);


Your plugin already honors this and will:

Treat sfb_is_pro_active() as true

Enable all Pro-gated features (server drafts, themes, white-label, etc.)

Hide upsells / show Pro UI

Extra-safe (optional)

If you prefer not to touch wp-config.php, drop this into a tiny mu-plugin or your theme’s functions.php:

add_filter('sfb_is_pro_active', function($valid){ 
  if (current_user_can('manage_options')) return true; // only admins
  return $valid;
}, 10, 1);

Guardrails (so we don’t ship it)

Add a loud admin notice when dev override is on:

if (defined('SFB_PRO_DEV') && SFB_PRO_DEV) {
  add_action('admin_notices', function(){
    echo '<div class="notice notice-warning"><p><strong>SFB Pro Dev Override:</strong> All Pro features are unlocked for this site. Disable before release.</p></div>';
  });
}


Before packaging for WordPress.org, remove the constant (or set to false).

That’s it—flip it on, take your screenshots, QA everything end-to-end, then flip it off before submission.
