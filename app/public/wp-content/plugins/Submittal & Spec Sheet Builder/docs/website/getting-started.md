## Key Concepts

### Product Hierarchy

Products are organized in a 3-level hierarchy:

```
Category (e.g., "C-Studs")
  └── Type (e.g., "20 Gauge")
      └── Products (e.g., "362S162-20", "600S162-20")
```

**Why This Structure?**
- Mimics how contractors think
- Enables smart filtering
- Groups related products
- Supports large catalogs

**Example Hierarchy:**
```
Track (C1P1)
  ├── 20 Gauge
  │   ├── 250T125-20
  │   └── 350T125-20
  └── 25 Gauge
      ├── 250T125-25
      └── 350T125-25
```

### Composite Keys

Each product has a unique composite key:

**Format:** `category-slug:type-slug:product-slug`

**Example:** `c-studs:20-gauge:362s162-20`

**Benefits:**
- Ensures uniqueness
- Enables relationships
- Supports filtering
- Prevents duplicates

### Specifications

Products have flexible key-value specifications that can be customized per catalog:

**Industry-Specific Fields:**
The plugin supports dynamic field definitions for different industries. Use the **⚙️ Manage Fields** button in the catalog builder to customize field names.

**Common Industry Presets:**
- **Steel/Construction:** Size, Flange, Thickness, KSI
- **HVAC:** BTU Rating, CFM, Voltage, SEER
- **Electrical:** Voltage, Amperage, Wattage, Phase
- **Plumbing:** Diameter, PSI, Material, GPM

**Custom Specs:**
- Add, remove, or rename any fields you need
- No limit on field count
- Searchable across all specs
- Displayed in cards and PDFs
- Changes apply to entire catalog
