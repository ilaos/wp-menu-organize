## Key Concepts

### Product Hierarchy

Products are organized in a 3-level hierarchy:

```
Category (e.g., "C-Studs")
  └── Type (e.g., "20 Gauge")
      └── Products (e.g., "362S162-20", "600S162-20")
```

**Why This Structure?**
- Mimics how contractors think
- Enables smart filtering
- Groups related products
- Supports large catalogs

**Example Hierarchy:**
```
Track (C1P1)
  ├── 20 Gauge
  │   ├── 250T125-20
  │   └── 350T125-20
  └── 25 Gauge
      ├── 250T125-25
      └── 350T125-25
```

### Composite Keys

Each product has a unique composite key:

**Format:** `category-slug:type-slug:product-slug`

**Example:** `c-studs:20-gauge:362s162-20`

**Benefits:**
- Ensures uniqueness
- Enables relationships
- Supports filtering
- Prevents duplicates

### Specifications

Products have flexible key-value specifications:

**Common Specs:**
- Size: `3-5/8"`
- Thickness: `33 mil (20 ga)`
- Flange: `1-5/8"`
- KSI: `50`

**Custom Specs:**
- Add any fields you need
- No limit on spec count
- Searchable across all specs
- Displayed in cards and PDFs
