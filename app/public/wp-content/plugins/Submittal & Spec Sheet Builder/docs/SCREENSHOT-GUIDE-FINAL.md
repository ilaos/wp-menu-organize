## Tips for Best Results

### Before Capturing
1. **Seed realistic data** - Use HVAC/Electrical products with real specs
2. **Configure branding** - Upload logo, set colors, fill company info
3. **Clear browser state** - Log out of other accounts, close unrelated tabs
4. **Disable extensions** - Use incognito mode or disable extensions
5. **Maximize window** - 1400px+ width for admin, responsive for frontend

### During Capture
1. **100% zoom** - For sharpest text rendering
2. **Include context** - Show enough UI to orient viewers
3. **Focus on key features** - Crop unnecessary whitespace
4. **Capture at exact moment** - Buttons visible, modals centered
5. **Check for consistency** - Same branding across PDF shots

### After Capture
1. **Review at thumbnail size** - Can you see key details when small?
2. **Test on retina display** - Does it look sharp on high-DPI screens?
3. **Get feedback** - Show to someone unfamiliar with the plugin
4. **Optimize file size** - Target <200KB without sacrificing quality
5. **Document what you captured** - Note any special setup needed

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Using Lorem Ipsum or "Test" data** - Makes plugin look unprofessional
‚úÖ Use realistic industry data (Variable Speed Drive - 50HP)

‚ùå **Screenshots too small** (<1000px wide) - Looks blurry on retina
‚úÖ 1200-1600px width for crisp display

‚ùå **Uploading to wrong SVN directory** (trunk/ or tags/)
‚úÖ Upload to assets/ directory only

‚ùå **Inconsistent branding** - Different logos/colors in PDF shots
‚úÖ Configure once, use for all screenshots

‚ùå **Forgetting 1px border** - Screenshots blend into white background
‚úÖ Add subtle border for visual separation

‚ùå **File size too large** (>1MB per screenshot)
‚úÖ Optimize with TinyPNG to <200KB

‚ùå **No context shown** - Just cropping to a single button
‚úÖ Show enough interface for viewers to understand location

‚ùå **Screenshots don't match captions** - Caption says one thing, image shows another
‚úÖ Double-check caption accuracy before submitting
