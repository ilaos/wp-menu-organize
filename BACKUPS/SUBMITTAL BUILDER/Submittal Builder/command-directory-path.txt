● Bootstrap file created successfully! The file has been overwritten with the exact code provided.

  Summary of changes:
  - Removed the init() method and its hook
  - Simplified enqueue_admin() to use ['jquery'] dependencies instead of WP-specific ones
  - Simplified enqueue_front() similarly
  - Updated shortcode to only accept id parameter (removed show_leed and cover_sheet)
  - Replaced full REST API routes with a simple /health endpoint stub
  - Removed API methods: api_get_form(), api_generate(), api_share()

  The file is ready for activation. You can now:
  1. Activate the plugin in WP Admin → Plugins
  2. Check the admin page at Submittal Builder in the sidebar
  3. Test the shortcode [submittal_builder id="1"] on a page
  4. Verify the REST endpoint at /wp-json/sfb/v1/health
